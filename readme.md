Item Search is a tiny client-optional, server-required mod that allows users to search nearby inventories for an item. To search, just type "/search <name/clear> [radius = 16]" and it will search in the specified radius for the item specified and place a visual marker above inventories that contain the item. "/search clear" for "/sc" will remove all markers.
